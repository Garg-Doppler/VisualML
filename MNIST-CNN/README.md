# Handwritten Digit Recognition using a Convoluted Neural Network.
This repository contains a **CNN** implemented in **TensorFlow.js**.

## Features

* Train the CNN using custom parameters.
* Visualise Training and Loss curves.
* Test the model using custom digits drawn by user on a canvas
* Visualise layer activations.
* Play around with a 3D model of the CNN.

## Dependencies
These dependencies are required to be installed.

* Node.js version 8.9 or higher
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable)

### How to build an example
```cd``` into the directory

If you are using ```yarn```:
```
cd MNIST
yarn
yarn watch
```


#### Details
The package contains two scripts:

```yarn watch```: starts a local development HTTP server which watches the filesystem for changes so you can edit the code (JS or HTML) and see changes when you refresh the page immediately.

```yarn build```: generates a dist/ folder which contains the build artifacts and can be used for deployment.
