# TensorFlow.js Example: Vanishing Gradients

This demo helps to visualize vanishing gradients by ploting various activation functions 
and using fully connected neural network to calculate gradients of loss and seeing them vanishing.
Data is used from:
[classic Iris flower data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)
using the Layers API of TensorFlow.js.




To launch the demo, do

```sh
yarn
yarn watch
```
