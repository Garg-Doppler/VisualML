# TensorFlow.js Example: Training a simple Autoencoder on MNIST

Train a model to autoencode handwritten digits from the MNIST database using the tf.layers api. The MNIST dataset is used as training data.

This examples lets you train a MNIST Autoencoder using a Fully Connected Neural Network (also known as a DenseNet).

-You can select the structure for the DenseNet and see the performance of the model.

-You can also 2d Visualize the encoded space

-You can also autoencode your drawing
